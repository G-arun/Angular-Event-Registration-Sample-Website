# Angular Event Registration Sample Website

This project is a sample application demonstrating a more fully developed realistic single page
angular application.

### Server

A node server is provided, run "npm install" and then either "server.sh" from the command line if you are on a linux box or "server.bat" if you are on a windows box.

### Running the application

Navigate your browser to `http://localhost:8000/` to see the app running in your browser. You may have to add the page to the url such as CompileSample.html if you wanna check out some sample pages I madde, which are not related to the event registration but demostrating different directives of Angular.
